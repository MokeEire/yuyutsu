Here's a compilation of resources that I have found useful for learning programming (largely related to data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization), and understanding policy.

# Programming

## R

- [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/): How I started learning R! An interactive tutorial in R itself.
- [Modern R with the tidyverse](https://modern-rstats.eu/): A great introduction to R with a focus on the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/): Explains efficient programming workflows and setting up your R environment
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/): Probably the most well known resource, I haven't used it too much but it has certainly been a useful reference from time to time
- [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/): Helpful for understanding how R works which will help you improve your programming skills with it
- [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/): Learn to develop web applications using R
- [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/): Learn how to create R packages
- [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/): My go-to reference for anything geospatial

## Python

- [Coding for Economists](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/intro.html)

## SQL

- [The SQL Tutorial for Data Analysis](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql)

## Statistics/Machine Learning

Statistics and Machine Learning could be its own section, but because a lot of the resources focus on programming too, I'm including it within programming.

- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)
- [Introduction to Econometrics with R](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/index.html)

## General Programming

- [git - the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

# Data Visualization

## Tools

- [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/): a colour palette generator
