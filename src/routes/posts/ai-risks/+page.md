The hype, fear, and corporate drama around artificial intelligence (AI) dominated our newsfeeds in 2023. 
You may have heard of the capabilities of AI models rapidly advancing over the past few years and you have likely interacted with a large language model (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Bing, or (hopefully not) Grok.

Are recommendation systems used by Netflix AI?
Have companies been using AI for decades?
