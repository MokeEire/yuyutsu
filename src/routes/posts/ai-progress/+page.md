Predictions are hard, especially about the future, and AI compounds a lot of our uncertainty about the future. It can seem like AI is advancing on a weekly or even daily basis, but will new discoveries and applications continue to develop at this breakneck speed? There are reasons to believe progress will plateau for the time being, but several potential breakthroughs lie on the horizon ready to accelerate things at a momentâ€™s notice.

AI has been progressing rapidly on several dimensions over the past decade. We have seen big jumps in capabilities in image and text generation, emerging capabilities in strategic planning, and downright dominance in a number of different strategy games and video games.

- Image generation has gone from blurry images in the early 2010s to winning international photography competitions in the early 2020s
- Text generation was unable to form grammatically correct sentences a decade ago. Now it demonstrates a variety of impressive conceptual reasoning abilities.

## Why progress might slow down

There are a few reasons to suspect AI progress will slow down in the near future:

1. Historically, AI has progressed with big jumps followed by lulls of activity that last years or decades.
2. The increases in computing power and availability of data over the past decade may not be replicable in the next decade
3. The advances in recent years, ChatGPT in particular, have focused public attention on the possibilities and dangers of AI which increase the likelihood that legislators will try to intervene.

These "AI winters" followed the excitement around AI in the 1950s when the field was first emerging, and again in the 1980s after initial commercial success of "expert systems".

## Why progress might continue

There is huge investment in computing power, data collection, and algorithmic research.
