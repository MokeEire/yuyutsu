---

I am an analyst, policy researcher, and data visualization designer living in Los Angeles, CA.

I am working to build a career that [improves institutional decision-making](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/improving-institutional-decision-making/) to generate as much positive impact for the world as I can.
Currently, I am learning about AI safety and governance through BlueDot Impact's [AI Safety Fundamentals program](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/). 
I have experience working on policy research in areas including justice, emerging technologies, and disaster relief as part of the RAND Corporation. 


Since the pandemic, I have been helping organizations develop their analytics capacity, building dashboards to put data in the hands of our customers, and designing data visualizations to communicate complex information to different audiences.
